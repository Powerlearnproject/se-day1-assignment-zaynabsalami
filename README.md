Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a field that requires the application of a systematic approach to test, develop, design, and maintain software applications or systems. Software engineering is important in the technology industry in some ways; it incorporates security measures ensuring software systems are secure and protect user data, and it also enables the creation of software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
NATO Software Engineering Conference
Development of structured programming and design
Agile methodologies and extreme programming (XP) 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning - first define your project goal, then identify stakeholders and resources. Develop a detailed project plan.
2. Gathering requirements - gather documents and software requirements from stakeholders. Create a software requirements specification document.
3. Analysis - study and interpret the software requirements and identify potential issues and risks. Create a detailed analysis document.
4. Design - create a detailed software design. Develop the software components and interfaces.
5. Coding - write a software code, develop and unit test individual components, and integrate components into a working system.
6. Testing - verify the software meets requirements, identify and fix defects, and conduct unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests.
7. Deployment - release software to production, configure and install the software, and provide training and support.
8. Maintenance - update software to meet changing requirements and ensure continued performance and reliability.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology has a linear and sequential approach while the agile methodology has an iterative and incremental approach. Also in the waterfall methodology, changes can be difficult when the product is underway while agile methodology allows for changes and adjustments throughout the project.
The waterfall methodology is suitable for projects  with well-defined requirements and limited changes, while the agile methodology is suitable for projects with uncertain or changing requirements. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. 
Software Developer - designs, develops, and tests the software applications
Quality assurance engineer - develops and executes a plan to ensure software quality
Project manager - oversees project planning, execution, and delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are important in improving productivity and enhancing code quality. Examples are Eclipse, Visual Studio
Version Control Systems (VCS) are important in tracking changes and updates, and maintaining version history. Examples are Git, Perforce

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some challenges software engineers face are changing requirements, security, privacy, scalability, user experience, and performance. 
Some of the ways these challenges can be overcome are by using flexible and adaptive planning techniques and implementing agile and iterative development. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - it tests individual components or units of code
Integration testing - it tests how units work together
System testing - it tests the entire software system
Acceptance testing - it tests the system from the user's perspective

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a process of designing and optimizing text prompts to interact effectively with AI models. it is important as it helps the AI models to understand the context and also saves time and allows user experience to be more efficient.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - write a story about a person
Improved prompt - write a 2-page story about a 30-year-old female astronaut who discovers a hidden planet while on a solo mission, including her emotions and decisions.
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides specific details and the language is straightforward.
